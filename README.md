# Snake

This project involves the development of a classic Snake game using Python and Pygame. The game features a snake that navigates a grid, consuming candy to grow longer. The primary challenge for players is to control the snake's movements, avoiding collisions with the game boundaries and, more critically, with its own body.

Key Features:

Snake Movement and Growth: Implement smooth controls for the snake's movement using arrow keys or a specified control scheme. When the snake consumes candy, it grows longer, increasing the difficulty of maneuvering.

Candy Generation: Randomly spawn candy on the game grid for the snake to consume. Each time the snake eats a candy, its length increases.

Collision Detection: Implement collision detection mechanisms to check for collisions between the snake and the game boundaries or the snake's own body. When a collision occurs, the game ends, providing a game-over screen.

Scoring System: Introduce a scoring system based on the length of the snake, encouraging players to achieve higher scores by consuming more candy.

Technologies Used:
- Python for game logic
- Pygame for the graphical user interface, rendering, and event handling
  
The Snake game provides a nostalgic and enjoyable gaming experience, combining classic gameplay mechanics with modern Python programming. The focus on smooth controls, dynamic growth, and the challenge of avoiding self-collisions ensures an engaging and entertaining gaming session for players of all levels.
